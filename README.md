This website is a redesign of the [CVS vaccine appointment page](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine). The project is completely recreational, and
any utility that anyone derives from it is completely accidental. My main reason for doing is to put emojis on a map.

## Tools

For this project I used (some might say abused) the following frameworks and packages:

- [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (scaffolding and serverless support)
- [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) (maps)
- [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (automated scraping, you can find that repository [here](https://github.com/bora-uyumazturk/scrape-covid-availability))
- [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) (easy data fetching)
- [vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) (deployment)

## Disclaimer

I am not in any way associated with CVS Pharmacy or their affilicates. This map only shows availability according to their appointment page and is not meant
to be comprehensive. Please keep in mind that CVS is only one place where you may find vaccines, and there are certainly many others.
